NOTES

Only one job can occupy memory!
You need to record (average) fragmentation at each time delta
You also need to record average wait time at each time delta,
Also average throughput at each time delta -> total throughput / total time at end of run
Also record jobs in queue for each time delta 
Also make a way that you can just skip the waiting (standard run at t=1, skip t=0)

This means that you need to make a scheduler


TODO
- Fragmentation for each memory
  - Do not actually minus 

SIDE NOTES
  - { JOB_ID: { time, size, status } }
  - { MEM_ID: { size, job, a_size } }
  - the wait queue is just for wait queue length analysis
  - TIME IS FROM JOB. WHEN WE CHECK THE TIME, WE CHECK JOBS[JOB_ID]["TIME"]


CHECKLIST:
  x algorithm
  - prompt for method & file
  - live loop
  - stats & analysis
